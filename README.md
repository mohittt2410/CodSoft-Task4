# CodSoft-Task4
This code creates a simple ATM with options to check balance, deposit, and withdraw money. 
It validates user input to ensure that amounts are positive and do not exceed the account balance for withdrawals. 
The ATM class is connected to the BankAccount class to access and modify the account balance.
The program will continue to display the menu until the user chooses the "Exit" option (choice 4).
